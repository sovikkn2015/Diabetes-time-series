# Diabetes-time-series

publicly available dataset corresponding to Protocol H, “A Randomized Trial Comparing Continuous Glucose Monitoring With and Without Routine Blood Glucose Monitoring in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes” from the following website:
https://public.jaeb.org/t1dx/stdy


a.	Glucose prediction algorithm that predicts glucose levels 30 minutes into the future. Focus on the data in table HDeviceCGM. primarily a CGM-only solution. 
b.	Data in HDeviceWizard to come up with a way to simulate the meal patterns of new “virtual subjects”. Analyze meal timing and size, fit distributions to this data, and use the distributions to create simulated meal data for newly created “virtual subjects” that come from the same population as the study participants.
